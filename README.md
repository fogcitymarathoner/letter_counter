# letter_counter
Counts letters in string

# Task
Build a small browser based application written in Python. The application should allow a user to count letters pasted into a browser dialog. Output should state how many instances of each letter were encountered, as in 'a' - 10 times, 'b' - 6, etc.  Demonstration of core and valued technologies beyond Python will help.  The solution should be completed within a few of hours.
